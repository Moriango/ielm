i'm a researcher, developer, musician, and architect with a passion for building the world around me. above all, i believe in pursuing the elegant integration of technology in our everyday actions and interactions. my dream is to dismantle the barriers between technology and the human experience through thoughtfully designed agent systems and novel computing environments.

my research and interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, architecture, robotics, ubiquitous | immersive computing, and cognitive science.  i'm a guitarist and synthesist, combining the two mediums to generate unique sounds and ambients, and love building audio-visual performance installations in my free time. i am also an avid climber. 

i am a graduate student at [rensselaer polytechnic institute]((https://rpi.edu)). my current work includes ontogen, a natural language generation system; gator, an autonomous dialog agent; and omicron, a multi-modal agent development framework.
